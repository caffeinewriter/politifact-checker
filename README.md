# Politifact Checker
Just a toy project to evaluate a pundit/candidate/random person's statements that have been evaluated by [Politifact](http://politifact.com/). This shouldn't be taken too seriously, as it's dependent on which/how many statements have been evaluated by Politifact.

As a note, the search currently will include ALL terms that are separated by spaces. This is a caveat of the library I used for it, and may or may not be fixed at some point.
